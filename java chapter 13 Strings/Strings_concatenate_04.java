// You're correct! In carbon compounds, multiple carbon atoms combine to form chains or networks. This process is called "catenation," which refers to the ability of carbon atoms to link together in long chains and complex structures through covalent bonds. This unique property of carbon allows it to form a vast variety of organic compounds, from simple hydrocarbons to large biomolecules like DNA and proteins.
//Concatenation is a term used in programming, whereas "catenation" is the accurate term for carbon chains. Thanks for pointing that out!
